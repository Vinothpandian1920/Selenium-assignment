1) What is Selenium? What are the different Selenium components? Explain about Selenium Webdriver.
    Selenium is a web based automated tool
    Automate only UI
   Components:
 There are Three components available :
    1. IDE
    2. Grid
    3. driver tool

  Explain:

    father of the tool : simon stewart 
    launch in : 2007
     * Selenium is a open source tool.
     * Selenium is a JAR file it does't application.
     * Selenium is used to contect the test on  functional and regression testing.
     * It can't automate desktop application and moblie application. 
     * selenium web driver allow the browsers  like ,chrome, firebox,edge,safari and opera .
     * selenium web driver allow the laungage like  java ,pythan,perl and ruby.
    

2) How does Selenium communicate with the Web browsers? 
   * The load URL is starting from https:// 
   * Ex: https://leafground.com/
   * https:// ---> this via communicate with web browser.

3.What are the locators available  to find an element using Selenium?
  
 There are 8 locators :

  1. id 2.className 3. name 4. text patg 5. link text 6. partial link text 7. xpath 8. css.

4. Why ID is preferable than X-Path?

  * id    : easy to acess and easybto find out the attribute value.
       
  * x-path: identification is little bit complicate .

5.How to select value in dropdown?
  There are 3 ways :
  1. select by value
  2. select by index
  3. select by visible text
6) What is the difference between Absolute Path and Relative Path?
  Absolute Path:
   It's starting from rootnode (html)
   It's starting from single slash.
  Relative Path:
   It's starting from current node 
   It's starting from double slash.
    


7) How to verify if the given radio button  is selected or not(safari radio button) (it is not taught but you can explore) Try here: https://leafground.com/radio.xhtml)

8)Difference between System.setProperty and WebDriverManager
     setProperty(“propertyName”, “value”)”. It implies that it sets the system property 'propertyName' to have the value 'value'.
 While testing with Selenium, you will make use of the setProperty method because the browser doesn't have a built-in server to run the automation code.

     WebDriverManager is an open-source Java library that carries out the management
 (i.e., download, setup, and maintenance) of the drivers required by Selenium WebDriver
 (e.g., chromedriver, geckodriver, msedgedriver, etc.) in a fully automated manner.

9) Write the syntax for preceding and following x-paths.
    Syntax: parent::node()

The below example will selects the parent node of the input tag of Id='email'.

Ex: //input[@id='email']/parent::* the above can also be re-written as //input[@id='email']/
   

10) How to get an attribute value using Selenium WebDriver?
   *Attribute value is get help of attribute 
   *Attribute colour is Red
   *Attribute value colour is Bule
   *Each and every html code are inbuild in attribte and attribute values 
   *Locators Attribute
